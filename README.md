## Usage
The following are the fuzzy functions implemented in this project.
### Fuzzy Gate Operations
- **ADD**: Adds two inputs. (capped at 1.0)
- **MULT**: Multiplies two inputs.
- **XOR**: Computes the absolute difference between two inputs.

### Fuzzy Set Operations
- **ADD**: Adds membership values from two input sets (capped at 1.0).
- **MULT**: Multiplies membership values from two sets.
- **XOR**: Computes the absolute difference between membership values from two input sets.
- **UNION**: Takes the maximum membership value for each element across two input sets.
- **INTERSECTION**: Takes the minimum membership value for each element across input two sets.
- **COMPLEMENT**: Inverts the membership value of each element from 1.0.
- **Î±-cut**: Filters elements whose membership values are greater than a given threshold.
